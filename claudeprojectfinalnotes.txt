These files contain course materials for CIS 232 (Fundamentals of Computer Science II), focused on Java programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming principles. * **Syllabus CIS 232.pdf** outlines the course structure, including topics like data structures, algorithms, recursion, and their analysis using Java. It also details the grading scheme, course schedule, and expectations. * **Introduction.pdf and Introduction 2.pdf** provide an overview of Java basics, including syntax, data types, variables, conditionals, loops, and object-oriented concepts like classes and objects. * **updated_Java Collections, Data Structures, and Iterators.pdf** offers an introduction to the Java Collections Framework, explaining its benefits, key data structures (arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, trees, hash tables), and the concept of iterators for navigating collections. * **Stack and Queue Implementation in Java.pdf** details the implementation of stack and queue data structures using both arrays and linked lists, along with explanations of their key operations and considerations for real-world use. * **LinkedList_Summary.pdf** provides a concise overview of linked lists, including the node structure, common methods (insertion, deletion, traversal, search), and example implementations. * **Recursion in Java.pdf** explains the concept of recursion, its key components (base case and recursive case), and demonstrates its application through examples like factorial and Fibonacci sequence calculations. * **Inheritance in Java.pdf** explores the concept of inheritance, its benefits, terminology (superclass, subclass, extends), and how it works in Java, including overriding methods and access modifiers. * **Constructors and Inheritance in Java.pdf** clarifies the relationship between constructors and inheritance, explaining how superclass constructors are called from subclass constructors and the use of the super keyword. * **Interfaces and Abstract Classes in Java.pdf** covers the concepts of interfaces and abstract classes, their key differences, benefits, and how they promote abstraction, polymorphism, and code reusability in Java programs. * **Generics in Java.pdf** introduces generics, their purpose, benefits (type safety, code reusability, readability), and how to use them in classes and methods. * **Sorting Algorithms.pdf** discusses various sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort), their principles, steps, code implementations, flowcharts, and time complexities. * **Important To Remember.pdf** provides a cheat sheet for essential concepts like class diagrams, flowcharts, time complexity analysis (Big O notation), and common data structure operations, serving as a quick reference for key points. * **Task 1.pdf** presents a programming task to create a gradebook calculator in Java, outlining the objectives, requirements (input, calculations, output), and offering tips for implementation. It also poses a challenge to handle dynamic student numbers. These files collectively form a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing core Java programming concepts and data structures, with a focus on object-oriented programming principles and algorithm design.
